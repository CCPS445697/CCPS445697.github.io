  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I am working toward going to the NFL and i do not really have a job i want to do after that. My whole life i have been dedicated to this one dream and one goal, because i know that i am not really good at anything else related to school or jobs. I am working towards my goal by working as hard as i can everyday, every practice, every lift even at home and on the weekends. I also know that to pursue my goal i need good grades so i have been working extra hard in the class rooms to help with it. My family and friends are the most necessary for my goals because, my family always supports and helps me whether that is going to camps or getting treatment or just motivation. I have also surrounded my self with friends that all want the same things, so i can never get taken off of my path. My short term goals are to finish school with at least a 3.2 gpa and go to a D1 school. I want to be known for my success and hard work, I want to be know for greatness. My main achievement i want to be remembered by right now is a state championship.</p>
